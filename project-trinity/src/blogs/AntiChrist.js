                                Christ is a Greek word meaning <i>oiled</i>, or <i>anointed</i> a highly refined

                                Jesus is the NEW MAN in man. when he becomes Christ. Oil is the manifestation of energy. 
                                The degree of its purification is what makes it of the nature of the real

                                Jesus was crucified at the age of 33. Jesus must reach the 33rd vertebrae 
                                of the spine to reach the place of the skull.
                                In the bible, Jesus is crucified at Golgotha which translates 
                                to <i>The Place of the Skull</i>. This is where the Medulla 
                                Oblongata meets the Cerebellum, and where the two fluid nerves
                                cross.

                                alongisde with Mary (the moon), two and a half days after the Spring Equinox. Take note

                                Interesting enough, as we state that Jesus is also the Sun of God, 
                                the Sun actually rules Leo Season. Leo, the Lion, is allegorical 
                                to our heart and undying energy. Here we can see a correlation between 
                                the fiery heart of Jesus and the fiery Sun (heart) found in Leo.

                                During the first 300 years of the Christian era all that has been above written was understood 
                                by the real Christians, and about the end of that time the persecution of these Essenes by the 
                                priesthood became so marked that they met in secret and
                                always made the sign of the fish.
                                About the year 325, Constantine, the pagan Roman Emperor, began to 
                                clothe the wonders of the human body in oriental imagery.

                                The council of Nicea, dominated by Constantine, voted that
                                the symbols of the human body were persons; that Jesus was a
                                certain historical man, a contention utterly and indubitably with
                                out foundation, in fact, and that all who believed the story
                                would be saved and forgiven here, and now.

                                To keep the world in ignorance of the operation of the Cosmic Law, they changed the Times and Seasons.

                                to January 1st (♑️), the Goat. This is a Cosmic War 
                                between good and evil, the Lamb and the Goat. Why do we choose to celebrate a new year when 
                                the earth is cold and dead? The astrological new year, full of life and energy, 
                                begins at the head of Aries, in March.

                                Jesus if saved and 'cast upon the waters (circulation)' reaches the 
                                pineal gland and cause it to vibrate at a rate that heals all manner

                                gluttony. Acids and alcohols cut, or chemically split, the oil

                                     “Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me

                                This is one of my favorite verses from the Bible. It is when 
                                Jesus is turned in, and Peter begins to deny Jesus, just as Jesus 
                                foretold.

                                The Rooster, in ancient times, is found in Scorpio. Scorpio pertains 
                                to the genitals, hence where we get the modern slang 'cock' from. The Cock

                                The natural man forever seeks pleasurable sensations, which is at enmity with God. 
                                Any act, coing under the meaning of sin, retards or prevents the automatic action of the seed, 
                                which if not interfered with, lifts up one-tenth of the life essense (oil), transmutes it, 
                                and regenerates the body, until the Ego desires to dissolve it by rates of motion set in 
                                action by its inherent will.

                                Returning back to Peter's Denial of Jesus, the Rooster or Cock is symbolical of 
                                the animal or carnal nature. The crowing of this animal is the most electrical, as it heralds the
                                approach of the Sun. This crowing corresponds to the physiological action of the 
                                caput gallinaginis (the wood-cock's head) in man. One must maintain a pure mind,
                                free from sin,  
                                and not deny Jesus. Even when the vibrations of the lower mind seem impossible to bear.

                                The Day of Judgement (Age of Aquarius) is upon us. Repent (creep back) from your sins (falling short). 
                                Ask for forgiveness.

                                    "Lord God, I come to you a sinner,
                                    And I humbly repent for my sins.
                                    I believe that Jesus is Lord.
                                    I believe you raised him from the dead.
                                    I would ask that Jesus come into my life,
                                    And to be my Lord and Savior.
                                    I receive Jesus to take control of my life,
                                    And that I may live with him from this day forward.
                                    Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood.
                                    In Jesus name, amen.
                                    Alright now, remember this day: the start of a new life
