                                The Nature of the Eternal Father is Almighty Force (Repulsion). 
                                The manifestation of this Almighty Force produces a vibration, a particular sound, the Word <i>Aum</i> (Amen).

                                The Heart, like an onion begins to unveil different layers of its existence. Like a lotus flower opening its petals, catching the dew drops of light, attracting atoms of higher nature,

                                He becomes free, and enters into the creation of Light. Under the influence of The Holy Spirit, the atoms

                                Individually, the atoms are known as <i>Ignorance</i>,

                                becomes a Son of God, he comprehends the universal light - The Holy Ghost - as a perfect whole, and his self as nothing but a mere idea resting on a

                                The inner-volume of every Atom (Adam) is 
                                Magneto-Dielectricity, the two symbiotic forces of the universe. 
                                When these two forces are joined together in harmony, 
                                they create the Atom, or electricity. The make up of this atom is The Torus & The Hyperbola.
                                The Hyperboloid is a double sink, hourglass shape that sits perfectly inside of the Toroidal. 
                                The Toroidal radiates out from the center up and around 
                                creating a donut shape as it returns back to the center.

                                These diverging and converging fields of pure energy and the loss of pure energy create all things in the universe. 
                                The Bull and El Toro, how I like to call it. For a very good reason to. Because as you innerstand this information, 
                                you begin to see everything in the world is just Toros and Bulls. Right-turning, Left-turning, Red, Blue, Wrong, Right, Up, Down. This polarity is 
                                the temporal construct of interference in the Ether.

                                The roots of our languages, were based on these truths. Many words contain variations of the vibrations <i>bol, lob, tor </i> 
                                and, <i>rot</i>.

                                This is super important to understand. It is a red-shift, blue-shift world. The Toro and The Bull. Maybe this 
                                will bring some understandment to the phrase, "Holy Cow". Truly this is the Holiest of Cows.

                                Conclusion
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                This constitutes <i>The Holy Trinity</i>. 
                                Dielectricity is the Father, Electricity is the Son, and Magnetism is the Holy Spirit. 
                                <i> The Holy Trinity</i> is the product of the two symbiotic forces in the Universe. 
                                The infinite fractals of this triplicity can be found throughout all of history, and in what 
                                is to come. To be unified with the Eternal Father for ever is the ultimate goal. And this 
                                is only possible through and with love. God is love, the power of love, the power of god, is our eternal truth. 
                                Life is unstable and unsafe, but love is our anchor that gives us our equilibrium. Would it be that the Heart Chakra is our 
                                equilibrium, hence why it is our middle chakra? Hence why Jesus the Son of God points to his Heart? Food for thought, and a quench for the mind.

                                My seventh entry, the perfect entry, the entry where I finally talk about  <i>Trinity</i>. Fun fact, I did not name myself after the character from 'The Matrix', even though it fits perfectly with its embodiment. 
                                I fell in love with the idea of <i>Trinity</i> being this other self that was connected to me, the same way my reflection is always attached to me, even when I am not in front of a mirror.

                                Funny enough, <i> The Holy Trinity</i>, or  <i>Trinity</i>, is truly a companion in all of our lives.

                                The true meaning of Marriage is the union of Spirit and Matter. 
                                When one accepts the Spiritual Love and Light, and creates a relationship with it. We must all have a marriage with our Spirit, before we can have relationships with others. 
                                We all have a dark-side, literally. So join hands, 
                                and know that love is the answer.
