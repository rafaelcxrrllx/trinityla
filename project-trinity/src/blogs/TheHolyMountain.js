                            could not resist seeing this movie the moment I came across
                            its movie poster. The Holy Mountain (La Montaña Sagrada)
                            is a surreal film written and directed by
                            Alejandro Jodorowsky from 1973. In a corrupt, greed-fueled world, 
                            a powerful alchemist leads a messianic character 
                            and seven materialistic figures to the Holy Mountain, 
                            where they hope to achieve enlightenment.

                                A Christlike figure wanders through bizarre, grotesque 
                                scenarios filled with religious and sacrilegious imagery.
                                 He meets a mystical guide who introduces him to seven wealthy 
                                 and powerful people, each representing a planet in the Solar 
                                 system. These seven, along with the protagonist, the guide 
                                 and the guide's assistant, divest themselves of their worldly
                                  goods and form a group of nine who will seek the Holy Mountain, 
                                  in order to displace the gods who live there and become immortal.

                                The Protagonist is the lower-self, the animal nature, the son
                                of man. He never speaks a word, and is easily influenced. In the film
                                he is a representation of Jesus and I would agree, 
                                however not a representation of Jesus Christ (yet).

                               There is a pack of boys in the film who placed
                               The Protagonist on a cross and began to stone 
                               him before he gained consciousness in the beginning of the film.
                               They come in and out of the two caves seen in the image above. 
                               These represent the 'Lost Boys', the procreative germs. When the
                               corpuscles of the body fall under the vibration of the lower mind, they are attracted
                               down to the testes, hence animal germs, termed negative in nature. 
                               The two caves in the mountain give shape to the Pubic Symphysis, 
                            </p>

                                One can state that in both esoteric and biological astrology, 
                                this is the negative energy of Scorpio, 
                                the Scorpion. The Lost Boys stoning The Protagonist on the cross 
                                symbolizes how the lower mind can kill the son of man, 
                                the psycho—physical seed, Jesus.

                                who is actually a drunken man as well. He blacks out
                                and during his time unconscious, his body is molded
                                and used to create dozens of christ-like figures. He wakes

                                taken advantage of. The only one who was destroyed was his many selves. 
                                The many selves who, over and over again, died and perished at the hands
                                of evil. Taking the very last of his self.

                                After releasing his self, The Protagonist comes across this tower
                                in the middle of town. It began to descend a hook from a hole located
                                at the top of the tower. 
                            </p>

                                    Gold from the Tower,  The Holy Mountain
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The hook which descended had a bag filled with gold. The
                                 commoners put grapes, bread, and fish on the hook to return to the top, 
                                 but our protagonist grabs a dagger and jumps on top of the hook, heading
                                 to the top. 
                            </p>

                           
                            <p>
                                A couple things to point out. First, the bag has the alchemical symbol 
                                of the Sun.
                                Secondly, the tower which sends down a hook filled with gold has a huge
                                esoteric meaning. The hook can be interpreted as the coccyx, which is 
                                the base of the spine. The tower, representing the spine, sends down gold
                                from the top to the sacrum, to feed all of the poor. Again, this should be 
                                intepreted as biochemical esoterism, as it is a representation of tithing. 
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tithing is the practice of taking or paying a tithe.
                                A tithe is one tenth of annual produce or earnings, that is taken
                                to support the Church. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here is where the deprogramming begins: 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tithing is done within the body when the higher mind gives one tenth of itself to feed 
                                the lower mind. The lower mind, 
                                represented as the commoners, are the dying corpuscles found in the body. 
                                Take note that this corrupted and dying society sends back grapes, fish, and bread specifically 
                                for a reason. The bread (fish) and the wine must be recieved at the top in exchange for the 
                                tenth of gold. However, this is not the correct bread and wine that must be sent to the upper chamber.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To truly give and not steal from God (Malachi 3:8) you must return 
                                the bread (jesus) and wine (blood) to him in the higher mind. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A person who dwells in the lower mind will say that tithing must be 
                                practiced with the State and Church, which steals your fruits of labor
                                to run a crooked system. The only tithing you owe is to your self, 
                                your higher mind. The only thief of gold from the higher mind is you.

                                The Solar Plexus and The Third Eye. A very interesting combination 
                                of Chakras. I will dive into Chakras in another blog, but for now 
                                I do wish to point out one thing. The Solar Plexus represents Earth, 
                                the Barren Manger, where the Father fructifies the Divine Child. 
                                The Third Eye, allows us to see the interconnectedness of the universe. 
                                Being all one, coming from all one, one can see the truth. Interesting 
                                how the Third Eye Chakra places a critical role in seeing the Truth, 
                                as The Spinning Room spins, allowing The Protagonist to 'see' the esoteric art.

                                This is not the end of the story, but I wish not to go further. Maybe I will create 
                                a part two, but there is so much to unpack, that I cannot spend more time on the matter. If you
                                have read this far, and are pure of heart, you will know what the remaining film represents. There 
                                are some very unique factors there, but we will save it for another day.

                                One of the best movies I have seen. I watched it a second time to complete this article. It truly 
                                is a beautfil and frightful depiction of what is going on inside of our bodies, our society, and 
                                our universe.
