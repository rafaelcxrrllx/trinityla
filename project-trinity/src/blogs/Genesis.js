                                ost-morteum thoughts: I know you want to be great. And trust me, you are. 
                                This world is governed by a power that has been around longer than anyone alive now can remember. 
                                I ask myself, where is the freedom to those born from a womb? As soon as we are delivered, we 
                                begin to be manufactured into a common person with hopes, dreams, desires, and fears. 
                                But are these imposed onto us or do we choose them in free-spirit?

                                I ask myself everyday whether I am living for me or am I living for someone else. Whether 
                                this other person is physically a person or an entity, it doesnt matter to me. I am an extension
                                of God, as long as my heart is just and pure, none of my actions will be made for others. 
                                I choose me. I want to help the world, not feed into its corrupt system imposed by man. 
                                As a soon graduating college student, this thought haunts my mind. 
                            </p>

                                I do not know what the future has waiting for me, but I know that I am manifesting a beautiful reality with me in it. 
                                I will have everything I dream of, as long as I stay connected with my higher self. A king and his horse. No matter who
                                or what comes in my path, I know that I am a golden star. No one can take that away from me. I may become heavy and dark
                                , but my true self will always be there. Waiting for me to call his name and let him in. I am only a vehicle for the soul. 
                                My light will never deminish and I will never stop growing and working for my higher self.

                                I am ready. I am ready to step outside of my self, and begin to create freely to my heart's content. 
                                No matter what happens, I know where I came from and where I am going. I shall dedicate every second
                                of my life to freeing myself and humanity. The way I will do this is through change. 
                                As I change my self, I will change what is around me. Like a dominoe, I will be the first to break
                                the cyclical traumas that no longer need to be passed down. I am grateful for being a part of this experience. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An embodiment of my higher self. I don't want fame or fortune. I just want to change the world. To get rid of all ways I was 
                                programmed to think that do not serve me, and truly surrender. I am grateful for my breathe, eyes, and all organs, limbs, 
                                textures that make up my body. I am divinity, living in my temple. I must no longer tarnish myself. I deserve the best. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I will never be deceived or misguided from the truth. I will place complete and unquestioned fate onto my self, 
                                and begin the journey. No more distractions, no more worries, no more fears. I am Trinity: Mind, Body, and Soul. 
                                May your will be done through my efforts. 
                            </p>
