                                where I will give a brief summary on each Zodiac and its corresponding 
                                cell salt it is associated with.

                                This wheel is based on the work done by 
                                Dr. George W. Carey, a famous biochemist and astrologer 
                                from the 1900s. His work and discoveries will help 
                                mankind free itself from ignorance, and finally place 
                                the stars rightfully where they belong! For centuries, 
                                astrology has been poisoned, perverted, and awfully 
                                misunderstood due to the lack of chemical, 
                                biological, astrological, and anatomical wisdom. These 
                                subjects in modern day have been completely perverted, 
                                leaving mathematics as one of the last true mediums of truth, 
                                where everything else has been manipulated and polluted.

                                <p>
                                    “It must always be remembered that astrology is the consideration of the body of the universe and, by analogy, the anatomy, therefore, of man.”

                                This is but a taste of the Cell Salts of Salvation by Dr George Carey. Sufficient to be understood, and 
                                to be pursued with curiosity. When one embarks on this story in great detail, he will be left speechless. 
                                As it is indeed, the unspoke wheel.

                                I feel very accomplished making this zodiac wheel. It lives in the ether, beyond me and anyone else. For this wheel
                                is above us. This is not my opinion, it is truth. Aligned with the truth, and contributing to the Great Work.
